  **Predictive Models for Anticipating Customer Churn in the Banking Industry**

**Problem Definition:**
Nowadays the banking industries are facing customer attrition, which was the major revenue loss
based on their expenses of bringing in new customers. The profitability is being sacrificed, the 
bank also needs to spend additional money to train new customers. The primary complexity is 
focused on the inability to predict and mitigate churn. For the client, customer attrition is posing 
a significant impact on profitability as well as creating an inability to maintain a customer base
with loyalty. The timely interventions of banking applications are also affected by a lack of real-
time insights into customer churn behavior, leaving vulnerability to the loss of primary clients to
the competitor. Addressing customer churn becomes very important in the competitive market to 
maintain profitability and customer trust. The project tackles the complexity of customer churn
by leveraging predictive models to analyze and Identify customers at risk from historical customer 
data such as account details, demographics, and transaction histories. Additionally, the project 
requires a dynamic system to predict a specific customer's probability of leaving the bank. 
Therefore, the problem statement is to develop a web-developed churn prediction system 
using predictive models and machine learning.
