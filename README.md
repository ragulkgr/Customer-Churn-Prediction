**Predictive Models for Anticipating Customer Churn in the Banking Industry**

üìå **Problem Statement:**
In the banking industry, customer retention is a key challenge. Banks invest heavily in customer acquisition, and losing existing customers can lead to significant revenue losses. Identifying potential churners in early state allows banking industry to take proactive measures to retain them.

We have access to historical customer data and aim to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to leave the bank. This will enable targeted retention strategies, reducing churn and improving customer satisfaction.

üìä **Data Overview:**
The dataset consists of historical banking customer information.

**Features:**

**Age (numeric)**: The customer's age.

**Job Type**: The occupation or employment category of the customer.

**Marital Status**: The marital status of the customer.

**Educational Qualification**: The education level of the customer.

**Account Type**: Type of banking account held by the customer.

**Transaction Frequency**: Number of transactions performed in a given period.

**Customer Tenure**: Duration (in years) the customer has been associated with the bank.

**Previous Interactions**: Outcome of previous retention efforts (categorical: "unknown", "other", "failure", "success").

**Target Variable:**

**Churn**: Whether the customer has left the bank (Yes/No).

üîç **Approach**

**Data Preprocessing**

Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables.
Scale numerical features for better model performance.

**Feature Engineering**

Create new features to capture customer behavior and engagement trends.
Extract insights from transaction patterns and tenure.

**Model Selection**

Evaluate different machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting to determine the best performing model.

**Model Training**

Train the model using cross-validation to ensure generalizability.

 **Model Evaluation**

Assess performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment

Integrate the trained model into banking systems for real-time churn prediction and retention strategy implementation.

üéØ **Output**

This project aims to develop a predictive model for customer churn in the banking sector. By analyzing customer demographics, account details, and transaction history, the model predicts the likelihood of churn, allowing banks to implement targeted retention campaigns. This improves customer loyalty while optimizing operational costs.
